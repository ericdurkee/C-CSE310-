# Overview

In this project, I developed a password strength checker using C++ to deepen my understanding of the language and its syntax. The software allows a user to input a password, checks for the presence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and provides feedback on the strength of the password as weak, moderate, or strong. Additionally, it enforces a minimum and maximum password length to ensure basic security guidelines.

The purpose of writing this software was to gain practical experience with C++ functions, loops, conditionals, and string manipulation, as well as to practice organizing code with reusable helper functions. I also explored using libraries like <cctype> for character checking, which gave me insight into standard C++ utilities for working with strings and characters.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
